    "0": "Develop a TypeScript function that takes a string as input and returns an object containing the frequency count of all the unique words in the text. The function should remove all punctuation marks and ignore case sensitivity. Additionally, contractions (e.g. \"can\\'t\" and \"won\\'t\") should be split into their constituent words (\"can\" and \"not\", \"will\" and \"not\", respectively) before counting. The output object should have each unique word as a key and the corresponding frequency count as the value. The function should be efficient and handle large amounts of text data.",
